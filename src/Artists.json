          "bio": "A native of Southern Louisiana, accordionist and singer Andrew Carriere brings a long family tradition into his playing. His father was the legendary Creole fiddler “Bebe” Carriere, his uncle was accordionist Eraste Carriere, and cousins Chubby, Calvin, and Roy Carrier are popular in the zydeco arena. Carriere moved to the Bay Area in the ’60s, learned accordion from the late Danny Poullard, and is featured vocalist on the California Cajun Orchestra’s “Not Lonesome Anymore” CD. He performs regularly with his own band, Andrew Carriere and the Zydeco Cajun Allstars, and is a frequent guest with groups including Creole Belles, CZ & the Bon Vivants, Sauce Piquante and Wild Catahoulas. As the “Great Migration” of the 20th Century spread regional culture to Urban centers around the country, thousands of Creoles and African Americans came to Northern California in search of opportunity. Andrew Carriere is a living example of the means by which that culture endures and spreads. Acting as the elder statesmen of the Cajun/Zydeco scene in Northern California and a mentor to many local musicians, Andrew embodies and perpetuates the flourishing of the genre in the region thousand of miles from its origin",
